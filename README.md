Three Point Problem Solver (work in progress)

By: Scott D. Hull, Field Camp 2016


This code is meant to be launched with Python 3 via the command terminal and is meant to be a calculator while the user is manually drawing the three point problem.

When prompted, enter (in feet) the elevation of your highest point, your lowest point, and an intermediate point.  Then, enter the distance (in feet) from the lowest point to the highest point.  The code will calculate and display the apparant dip as well as the distance from the highest point to the point where strike would intersect the line between the highest and lowest point.

Once this strike line is drawn on your paper, draw a line perpendicular from the strike line to the highest point.  This should form a right triangle.  Take the angle from the highest point to the strike line (within the right triangle) and enter when prompted.  The code will calculate both the distance of this leg of the triangle (the distance from the highest point to where your perpendicular line intersects the strike line) as well as the true dip.


Disclaimer: This code is not finished.  Please check your work and report any problems with the code to me.
